<h1>Hi, I'm Esther</h1>

<p>
I'm a frontend developer based in Nigeria. I currently work at 
<a href="https://helixgade.com.ng/" target="_blank">Helixgade Technologies</a>. 
I am also a parttime engineer at
<a href="https://github.com/olotusquare" target="_blank">Olotu Square</a>. 
Previously, I worked at
<a href="https://github.com/Bernode-Hub" target="_blank">Bernode Hub</a>.
I enjoy learning new technologies and understanding the creation process behind digital products. 
When I'm not coding (which is rare), I love watching horror movies or taking walks.
