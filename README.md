<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Esther</h1>

<p align="center">
I'm a frontend developer based in Nigeria. I currently work at 
<a href="https://github.com/Bernode-Hub" target="_blank">Bernode Hub</a>. 
Previously, I was a frontend developer at 
<a href="https://github.com/olotusquare" target="_blank">Olotu Square</a>. 
I enjoy learning new technologies and understanding the creation process behind digital products. 
When I'm not coding (which is rare ðŸ˜„), I love watching horror movies or taking walks.
